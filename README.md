## MRF Array methods

If you’re starting in JavaScript, maybe you haven’t heard of .map(), .reduce(), and .filter(). For me, it took a while as I had to support Internet Explorer 8 until a couple years ago. But if you don’t need to be compatible with this very old browser, you have to become familiar with those methods.

### Take Notes(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
## **Map Method :** 
### The map method is used to create a new array with the result of a callback function called on each element in the original array.<br> The callback function takes one argument, the current element, and returns the new value for that element


## **Filter Method : **
### Filter - The filter method is used to filter an array based on a certain condition. The filter method takes a callback function as its argument, which is called on each element in the array. If the function returns true, the element is included in the new filtered array.
